# ReSOLUTION

SOLUTIONS for High ReSOLUTION Mass Spectrometry. 
The name ReSOLUTION comes from both high resolution mass spectrometry data (the basis of the package) and the [SOLUTIONS](https://www.solutions-project.eu/) project under which it was developed. This package provides workflow functionality for non-target screening with high resolution mass spectrometry and many functions for interacting with MetFrag.
Many colleagues contributed snippets, thoughts and ideas; including those acknowledged as contributors, in individual functions and beyond. Thank you to all of you.

## Installing

ReSOLUTION is an R package; see DESCRIPTION file for more details. 
It can be installed directly from github, e.g. in RStudio:

```
library(devtools)
install_github("schymane/ReSOLUTION")
```

### Documentation

Individual functions are documented, in many cases extensively, and are best viewed within the R environment, e.g. RStudio. These include examples where possible; the package contains a collection of data to use or links to data in other R packages. 

### Disclaimer

This is a collection of functions developed over many years, some I would now do very differently. The focus is on getting code out there (rather than stuck on my C drive) to help those of you using our computational mass spec developments in R to interact with them. Some of the newest functions are for features and data not yet available but coming soon - please read the documentation in R carefully. I hope some of you find this helpful as a starting point to develop better things!
